# LLM assisted Mutation Tool

A tool that mutates Java source files using OpenAI GPT models and specific mutation operators. Useful for testing Java code resilience, analyzing LLM-assisted changes, and exploring mutation testing patterns.

## üìù Version History

### 2.0.0
- Added Electron based GUI
- Windows `.bat` and macOS `.command` launchers
- Java CLI integration with GUI
- Improved user guidance in README

### 1.0.0
- Initial release: CLI-only mutation engine

---

## üì¶ Requirements

- Java 21+
- Maven 3.5+
- OpenAI API Key (via `OPENAI_API_KEY` env variable)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

Clone the repo and run:

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

This will build the CLI jar and get the project ready to use.

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Tool (Using CLI)

1. **For Single File Mutation:**

You can mutate a single Java file using the following command:

```
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-f /path/to/java/file.java"
```


2. **For Mutating Multiple Files in a Directory:**

To mutate all Java files within a directory, run the following command:

```
  mvn exec:java -Dexec.args="-dir /path/to/java/file/directory"
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Running the Tool (Using GUI)

1. **On Windows:**

Double click or run:
```
  run.bat
```

2. **On macOS/Linux:**

Make the script executable (only needed once):
```
  chmod +x run.command
```

Then run:
```
  ./run.command
```
You can also double click run.command in Finder if permissions are set.

## üåç Storing the OpenAI API Key

The OpenAI API Key is required to interact with OpenAI's GPT models.

### 1. On Windows:

To store the API key in your environment variables, follow these steps:

- Search for **Environment Variables** in the Windows search bar.
- Click **Edit the system environment variables**.
- Under the **System Properties** window, click on **Environment Variables**.
- In the **System variables** section, click **New**.
- Set the **Variable Name** to `OPENAI_API_KEY` and the **Variable Value** to your OpenAI API key.
- Click **OK** and restart your terminal to apply the changes.

### 2. On macOS:

- Open your terminal.
- Use the following command to open the `.bash_profile` (or `.zshrc` for newer macOS versions using Zsh):

  ```
  nano ~/.bash_profile
  ```

  or for Zsh users:

  ```
  nano ~/.zshrc
  ```

- Add the following line to the file:

  ```
  export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
  ```

- Save and exit by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`.
- Apply the changes by running:

  ```
  source ~/.bash_profile
  ```

  or for Zsh users:

  ```
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

Your API key will now be available as an environment variable.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### Build Stability After Mutation

The mutated code generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) may introduce compilation or runtime issues. This tool is designed to inject mutants into the codebase and does **not** compile or validate the entire project after mutation.

As a result, the build may fail or unexpected errors may arise. In such cases, **manual intervention is required** to inspect, fix, and stabilize the codebase to ensure it compiles and behaves correctly.
